# Amazon-Sales
Solo project involving the utilisation of Pandas and Matplotlib for data reading and exploration, with the integration of Seaborn for enhanced data visualization. RISE was incorporated to generate a slideshow for effective data presentation. Post data cleaning and exploration, the project automated the identification of top-selling items, leading sellers in various regions, and the percentage of sales prices. Emphasis was placed on improving table formatting for better readability, categorizing products, and creating custom tables based on specific requirements. Additionally, the analysis covered prices in different currencies, providing insights into safe shopping choices on Amazon and identifying optimal purchase times.
